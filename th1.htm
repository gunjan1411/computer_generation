        The invention of the silicon integrated circuit by Jack Kilby and Robert Noyce (working independently) in
        1958
        allowed dozens of transistors to be put on a single chip. This packaging made it possible to build computers
        that were smaller, faster, and cheaper than their transistorized predecessors. Some of the more significant
        Computers from this generation are described below.

        By 1964 IBM was the leading computer company and had a big problem with its two highly successful <a href="th1.htm"></a> and
        profitable
        machines, the 7094 and the 1401: they
        were as incompatible as two machines could be. One was a high-speed number cruncher
        using parallel binary arithmetic on 36-bit registers, and the other was a glorified input/output processor
        using
        serial decimal arithmetic on variable-length words in memory. Many of its corporate customers had both and
        did
        not like the
        One was a high-speed number
        idea of having two separate programming departments with nothing in common.
        When the time came to replace these two series, IBM took a radical step. It in- troduced a single product
        line,
        the System/360, based on integrated circuits, that was designed for both scientific and commercial
        computing.
        The System/360 con- tained many innovations, the most important of which was that it was a family of about a
        half-dozen machines with the same assembly language, and increasing size and power. A company could replace
        its
        1401 with a 360 Model 30 and its 7094 with a 360 Model 75. The Model 75 was bigger and faster (and more
        expensive), but software writen for one of them could, in principle, run on the other. In prac- tice, a
        program
        written for a small model would run on a large model without prob- lems. However, the reverse was not true.
        When
        moving a program written for a large model to a smaller machine, the program might not fit in memory. Still,
        this was a major improvement over the situation with the 7094 and 1401. The idea of machine families caught
        on
        instantly, and within a few years most computer manu- facturers had a family of common machines spanning a
        wide
        range of price and performance. Some characteristics of the initial 360 family are shown in Fig.


        Other models were introduced later.
        [03/06, 6:25 pm] Gunjan: Another major innovation in the 360 was multiprogramming, having several programs
        in
        memory at once, so that when one was waiting for input/output too complete, another could compute. This
        resulted
        in a higher CPU utilization.
        The 360 also was the first machine that could emulate (simulate) other com puters. The smaller models could
        emulate the 1401, and the larger ones could emulate the 7094, so that customers could continue to run their
        old
        unmodified bi- nary programs while converting to the 360. Some models ran 1401 programs so much faster than
        the
        1401 itself that many customers never converted their pro-
        grams.
        Emulation was easy on the 360 because all the initial models and most of the later models were
        microprogrammed.
        All IBM had to do was write three micro- programs, for the native 360 instruction set, the 1401 instruction
        set,
        and the 7094
        instruction set. This flexibility was one of the main reasons microprogramming was
        introduced in the 360. Wilkes' motivation of reducing tube count no longer mattered, of course, since the
        360
        did not have any tubes.
        The 360 solved the dilemma of binary-parallel versus serial decimal with a compromise: the machine had 16
        32-bit
        registers for binary arithmetic, but its memory was byte-oriented, like that of the 1401. It also had 1401
        style
        serial in- structions for moving variably sized records around memory.
        Another major feature of the 360 was a (for that time) huge address space of 2 (16,777,216) bytes. With
        memory
        costing several dollars per byte in those days, this much memory looked very much like infinity.
        Unfortunately,
        the 360 series was later followed by the 370, 4300, 3080, 3090, 390 and z series, all using essentially the
        same
        architecture. By the mid 1980s, the memory limit became a real problem, and IBM had to partially abandon
        compatibility when it went to 32-bit addresses needed to address the new 2-byte memory
        With hindsight, it can be argued that since they had 32-bit words and registers anyway, they probably should
        have had 32-bit addresses as well, but at the time no one could imagine a machine with 16 million bytes of
        memory. While the tran- sition to 32-bit addresses was successful for IBM, it was again only a temporary
        solution to the memory-addressing problem, as computing systems would soon re- quire the ability to address
        more
        than 2 (4,294,967,296) bytes of memory. In a few more years computers with 64-bit addresses would appear on
        the
        scene.
        The minicomputer world also took a big step forward in the third generation with DEC's introduction of the
        PDP-1l series, a 16-bit successor to the PDP-8. In
        many ways, the PDP-11 series was like a little brother to the 360 series just as the
        PDP-1 was like a little brother to the 7094. Both the 360 and PDP-11 had word-oriented registers nd a
        byte-oriented memory and both came in a range spanning a considerable price/performance ratio. The PDP-11
        was
        enormously successful, especially at universities, and continued DEC's lead over the other
        minicomputer manufacturers.
