        The transistor was invented at Bell Labs in 1948 by John Bardeen, Walter Brat- tain, and William Shockley,
        for
        which they were awarded the 1956 Nobel Prize in physics. Within 10 years the transistor revolutionized
        computers, and by the late 1950s, vacuum tube computers were obsolete. <br>

        <br>The first transistorized computer was
        built at M.I.T's Lincoln Laboratory, a 16-bit machine along the lines of the
        Whirlwind I. It was <a href=""></a> called the TX-0 (Transistorized eXperimental computer 0) and was merely intended as a
        device
        to test the much fancier TX-2.
        The TX-2 never amounted to much, but one of the engineers working at the
        Laboratory, Kenneth Olsen, formed a company, Digital Equipment Corporation (DEC), in 1957 to manufacture a
        commercial machine much like the TX-0. It was four years before this machine, the PDP-1, appeared, primarily
        because the venture capitalists who funded DEC firmly believed that there was no market for com- puters.
        After
        all, T.J. Watson, former president of IBM, once said that the world
        market for computers was about four or five units. Instead, DEC mostly sold small
        circuit boards to companies to integrate into their products.
        When the PDP-1 finally appeared in 1961, it had 4096 18-bit words of core memory and could execute 200,000
        instructions/sec. This performance was half that of the IBM 7090, the transistorized successor to the 709,
        and
        the fastest com- puter in the world at the time. The PDP-1 cost $120,000; the 7090 cost millions.
        DEC sold dozens of PDP-1s, and the minicomputer industry was born.
        One of the first PDP-1s was given to M.I.T., where it quickly attracted the attention of some of the budding
        young geniuses so common at M.I.T. One of the
        PDP-1's many innovations was a visual display and the ability to plot points any- where on its 512-by-512
        pixel
        screen. Before long, the students had programmed the PDP-l to play Spacewar, and the world had its first
        video
        game.
        A few years later DEC introduced the PDP-8, which was a 12-bit machine, but much cheaper than the PDP-1
        ($16,000). The PDP-8 had a major innovation:a single bus, the omnibus, as shown in Fig. 1-6. A bus is a
        collection of parallel
        Wires used to connect the components of a computer. This architecture was a major departure from the
        memory-centered IAS machine and has been adopted by nearly all small computers since. DEC eventually sold
        50,000
        PDP-8s, which es- tablished it as the leader in the minicomputer business.




        Meanwhile, IBM's reaction to the transistor was to build a transistorized ver- sion of the 709, the 7090, as
        mentioned above, and later the 7094. The 7094 had a cycle time of 2 microsec and a core memory consisting of
        32,768 words of 36 bits each. The 7090 and 7094 marked the end of the ENIAC-type machines, but they
        dominated
        scientific computing for years in the 1960s.
        At the same time that IBM had become a major force in scientific computing with the 7094, it was making a
        huge
        amount of money selling a little business-ori- ented machine called the 1401. This machine could read and
        write
        magnetic tapes, read and punch cards, and print output almost as fast as the 7094, and at a fraction of the
        price. It was terrible at scientific computing, but for business record keeping it was perfect.
        The 1401 was unusual in that it did not have any registers, or even a fixed word length. Its memory was 4000
        8-bit bytes, although later models supported up to a then-astounding 16,000 bytes. Each byte contained a
        6-bit
        character, an adminis- trative bit, and a bit used to indicate end-of-word. A MOVE instruction, for ex-
        ample,
        had a source and a destination address and began moving bytes from the sOurce to the destination until it
        hit
        one with the end-of-word bit set to 1.
        In 1964 a tiny, unknown company, Control Data Corporation (CDC), intro duced the 6600.
        a machine that was nearly an order of magnitude faster than the mighty 7094 and every other machine in
        existence
        at the time. It was love at first sight among the number crunchers, and CDC was launched on its way to
        success.
        The secret to its speed, and the reason it was so much faster than the 7094, was that inside the CPU was a
        highly parallel machine. It had several functional units for doing addition, others for doing
        multiplication,
        and still another for division, and all of them could run in parallel. Although getting the most out of it
        required care- ful programming, with some work it was possible to have 10 instructions being ex-
        ecuted at once.
        As if this was not enough, the 6600 had a number of little computers inside to help it, sort of like Snow
        White
        and the Seven Vertically Challenged People. This meant that the CPU could spend all its time crunching
        numbers,
        leaving all the de- tails of job management and input/output to the smaller computers. In retrospect, the
        6600
        was decades ahead of its time. Many of the key ideas found in modern computers can be traced directly back
        to
        the 6600.
        The designer of the 6600, Seymour Cray, was a legendary figure, in the same league as Von Neumann. He
        devoted
        his entire life to building faster and faster machines, now called supercomputers, including the 6600, 7600,
        and
        Cray-1. He also invented a nOw-famous algorithm for buying cars: you go to the dealer closest to your house,
        point to the car closest to the door, and say: *Il take that one.
        This algorithm wastes the least time on unimportant things (like buying cars) to leave you the maximum time
        for
        doing important things (like designing supercom- puters).
        There were many other computers in this era, but one stands out for quite a dif- ferent reason and is worth
        mentioning: the Burroughs B5000. The designers of machines like the PDP-1, 7094, and 6600 were all totaly
        preoccupied with the hardware, making it either cheap (DEC) or fast (IBM and CDC). Software was al- most
        completely irrelevant. The B5000 designers took a different tack. They built a machine specifically with the
        intention of having it programmed in Algol 60, a forerunner of C and Java, and included many features in the
        hardware to ease the compiler's task. The idea that software also counted was born. Unfortunately it was
        forgotten almost immediately.
