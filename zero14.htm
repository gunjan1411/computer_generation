        The first person to build a working calculating machine was the French scien- tist Blaise Pascal
        (1623-1662), in
        whose honor the programming language Pascal is named. This device, built in 1642, when Pascal was only 19,
        was
        designed to help his father, a tax collector for the French government. It was entirely mechani- cal, using
        gears, and powered by a hand-operated crank. <br>

            Pascal's machine could do only a subtraction operations, but thirty years later the great German
            mathematician Baron Gottfried Wilhelm von Leibniz (1646-1716) built another mechanical machine that could
            multiply and divide as
            well. In effect, Leibniz had built the equivalent of a four-function pocket calcula-
            tor three centuries ago.
            Nothing much happened for the next 150 years until a professor of mathemat- ics at the University of
            Cambridge,
            Charles Babbage (1792-1871), the inventor of
            the speedometer, designed and built his difference engine. This mechanical de- vice,
            which like Pascal's could only add and subtract, was designed to compute tables of numbers useful for naval
            navigation. The entire construction of the ma- chine was designed to run a single algorithm, the method of
            finite differences using polynomials. The most interesting feature of the difference engine was its output
            method: it punched its results into a copper engraver's plate with a steel die, thus foreshadowing later
            write-once media such as punched cards and CD-ROMs.
            Although the difference engine worked reasonably well, Babbage quickly got bored with a machine that could
            run
            only one algorithm. He began to spend in- creasingly large amounts of his time and family fortune (not to
            mention 17,000 pounds of the government's money) on the design and construction of a successor called the
            analytical engine. The analytical engine had four components: the store (memory), the mill (computation
            unit),
            the input section (punched-card reader), and the output section (punched and printed output). The store
            consisted of 1000 words of 50 decimal digits, each used to hold variables and results. The mill could accept
            operands from the store, then add, subtract, multiply, or divide them, and fi- nally return the result to
            the
            store. Like the difference engine, it was entirely me- chanical.
            The great advance of the analytical engine was that it was general purpose. It read instructions from
            punched
            cards and carried them out. Some instructions commanded the machine to fetch two numbers from the store,
            bring
            them to the mill, be operated on (e.g., added), and have the result sent back to the store. Other
            instructions
            could test a number and conditionally branch depending on whether it was positive or negative. By punching a
            different program on the input cards, it was possible to have the analytical engine pertorm different
            computations, some- thing not true of the difference engine.
            Since the analytical engine was programmable in a simple assembly language, it needed software. To produce
            this
            software, Babbage hired a young woman named Augusta Ada Lovelace, who was the daughter of famed British poet
            Lord
            Byron. Ada Lovelace was thus the world's first computer programmer. The pro- gramming language Ada is named
            in
            her honor.
            Unfortunately, like many modern designers, Babbage never quite got the hard ware debugged. The problem was
            that
            he needed thousands upon thousands of cogs and wheels and gears produced to a degree of precision that
            nineteenth-cen- tury technology was unable to provide. Nevertheless, his ideas were far ahead of his tume,
            and
            even today most modern computers have a structure very similar to the analytical engine, so it is certainly
            fair
            to say that Babbage was the (grand)father of the modern digital computer.
            The next major development occurred in the late 1930s, when a German engin- eering student named Konrad Zuse
            built a series of automatic calculating machines using electromagnetic relays. He was unable to get
            government
            funding after wWII began because government bureaucrats expected to win thne war so quickly that the new
            machine
            would not be ready until after i1t was over. Zuse was unaware
            [03/06, 6:10 pm] Gunjan: of Babbage's work, and his machines were destroyed by the Allied bombing of Berlin
            in
            1944, so his work did not have any influence on subsequent machines.Still, he was one of the pioneers of the
            field.
            Slightly later, in the United States, two people also designed calculators, John Atanasoff at lowa State
            College
            and George Stibbitz at Bell Labs. Atanasoff's ma- chine was amazingly advanced for its time. It used binary
            arithmetic and had capacitors for memory, which were periodically refreshed to keep the charge from leaking
            out,
            a process he called "jogging the memory." Modern dynamic memory (DRAM) chips work the same way.
            Unfortunately
            the machine never really became operational. In a way, Atanasoff was like Babbage: a visionary who was
            ultimately defeated by the inadequate hardware technology of his time.
            Stibbitz computer, although more primitive than Atanasoff'S, actually worked.
            Stibbitz gave a public demonstration of it at a conference at Dartmouth College in 1940. Among those in the
            audience was John Mauchley, an unknown professor of physics at the University of Pennsylvania. The computing
            world would hear more about Prof. Mauchley later.
            While Zuse, Stibbitz, and Atanasoff were designing automatic calculators, a young man named Howard Aiken was
            grinding out tedious numerical calculations by hand as part of his Ph.D. research at Harvard. After
            graduating,
            Aiken recog- nized the importance of being able to do calculations by machine. He went to the library,
            discovered Babbage's work, and decided to build out of relays the gener- al-purpose computer that Babbage
            had
            failed to build out of toothed wheels.
            Aiken's first machine, the Mark I, was completed at Harvard in 1944. It had 72 words of 23 decimal digits
            each
            and had an instruction time of 6 sec. Input and output used punched paper tape. By the time Aiken had
            completed
            its successor, the Mark II, relay computers were obsolete. The electronic era had begun.
