        The stimulus for the electronic computer was World War II. During the early part of the war, German
        submarines
        were wreaking havoc on British ships. Com- mands were sent from the German admirals in Berlin to the
        submarines
        by radio, which the British could, and did, intercept. The problem was that these messages were encoded
        using a
        device called the ENIGMA, whose forerunner was designed by amateur inventor and former U.S. president,
        Thomas
        Jefferson. <br>

        Early in the war, British intelligence managed to acquire an ENIGMA machine from Polish Intelligence, which
        had
        stolen it from the Germans. However, to break a coded message, a huge amount ot computation was needed, and
        it
        was needed very soon after the message was intercepted to be of any use. <a href="first.htm"></a>
    To decode these messages, the
    British
    government set up a top secret laboratory that built an elec- tronic computer called the COLOSSUS. The
    famous
    British mathematician Alan
    Turing helped design this machine. The COLOSSUS was operational in 1943, but since the British government
    kept
    virtually every aspect of the project classified as
    military secret for 30 years, the COLOSSUS line was basically a dead end. It is worth
    noting only because it was the world's first electronic digital computer. <br>
    In addition to destroying Zuse's machines and stimulating the construction of the COLOSSUS, the war also
    affected computing in the United States. The army needed range tables for aiming its heavy artillery. It
    produced these tables by hir- ing hundreds of women to crank them out using hand calculators (women were
    thought
    to be more accurate than men). Nevertheless, the process was time con- suming and errors often crept in.
    John Mauchley, who knew of Atanasoff's work as well as Stibbitz', was aware that the army was interested in
    mechanical calculators. Like many computer scien- tists after him, he put together a grant proposal asking
    the
    army for funding to build an electronic computer. The proposal was accepted in 1943, and Mauchley and his
    graduate student, J. Presper Eckert, proceeded to build an electronic com- puter, which they called the
    ENIAC
    (Electronic Numerical Integrator And
    Computer). It consisted of 18,000 vacuum tubes and 1500 relays. The ENIAC weighed 30 tons and consumed 140
    kilowatts of power. Architecturally, the ma- chine had 20 registers, each capable of holding a 10-digit
    decimal
    number. (A dec imal register is very small memory that can hold one number up to some maximum number of
    decimal
    digits, somewhat like the odometer that keeps track of how far a car has traveled in its lifetime.) The
    ENIAC
    was programmed by setting up 6000 multiposition switches and connecting a multitude of sockets with a
    veritable
    for- est of jumper cables. <br>
    The machine was not finished until 1946, too late to be of any use for its origi- nal purpose. However,
    since
    the war was over, Mauchley and Eckert were allowed to organize a summer school to describe their work to
    their
    scientific colleagues.
    That summer school was the beginning of an explosion of interest in building large digital computers.
    After that historic summer school, many other researchers set out to build elec- tronic computers. The first
    one
    operational was the EDSAC (1949), built at the
    University of Cambridge by Maurice Wilkes. Others included the JOHNNIAC at the Rand Corporation, the ILLIAC
    at
    the University of Illinois, the MANIAC at
    Los Alamos Laboratory, and the WEZAC at the Weizmann Institute in Israel.
    Eckert and Mauchley soon began working on a successor, the EDVAC (Elec- tronic Discrete Variable Automatic
    Computer). However, that project was fatally wounded when they left the University of Pennsylvania to form a
    startup company, the Eckert-Mauchley Computer Corporation, in Philadelphia (Silicon
    Valley had not yet been invented). After a series of mergers, this company became the modern Unisys
    Corporation.
    As a legal aside, Eckert and Mauchley filed for a patent claiming they invented the digital computer. In
    retrospect, this would not be a bad patent to own. After years of litigation, the courts decided that the
    Eckert-Mauchley patent was invalid and that John Atanasoff invented the digital computer, even though he
    never
    patented it, effectively putting the invention in the public domain.
    [03/06, 6:14 pm] Gunjan: While Eckert and Mauchley were working on the EDVAC, one of the people involved in
    the
    ENIAC project, John von Neumann, went to Princeton's Institute of
    Advanced Studies to build his own version of the EDVAC, the IAS machine. Von
    Neumann was a genius in the same league as Leonardo Da Vinci. He spoke many languages, was an expert in the
    physical sciences and mathematics, and had total recall of everything he ever heard, saw, or read. He was
    able
    to quote verbatim from memory the text of books he had read years earlier. At the time he became interested
    in
    computers, he was already the most eminent mathematician in the
    world. <br>
    It was soon apparent to him that programming computers with huge numbers of switches and cables was slow,
    tedious, and inflexible. Hle came to realize that the program could be represented in digital form in the
    computer's memory, along with the data. He also saw that the clumsy serial decimal arithmetic used by the
    ENIAC, with each digit represented by 10 vacuum tubes (1 on and 9 off) could be replaced by using parallel
    binary arithmetic, something Atanasoff had realized years earlier.
    The basic design, which he first described, is now known as a von Neumann machine. It was used in the EDSAC,
    the
    first stored-program computer, and even now, more than half a century later, is still the basis for nearly
    all
    digital com- puters. This design, and the IAS machine, built in collaboration with Herman
    Goldstine, has had such an enormous influence that it is worth describing briefly.
    Although Von Neumann's name is always attached to this design, Goldstine and others made major contributions
    to
    it as well. A sketch of the architecture.

    The von Neumann machine had five basic parts: the memory, the arithmetic logic unit, the control unit, and
    the
    input and output equipment. The memory con- sisted of 4096 words, a word holding 40 bits, each a 0 or a 1.
    Each
    word held ei- ther two 20-bit instructions or a 40-bit signed integer. The instructions had 8 bits devoted
    to
    telling the instruction type and 12 bits for specifying one of the 4096
    memory words. Together, the arithmetic logic unit and the control unit formed the
    "brain" of the computer. In modern computers they are combined onto a single chip called the CPU (Central
    Processing Unit).
    Inside the arithmetic logic unit was a special internal 40-bit register called the accumulator. A typical
    instruction added a word of memory to the accumulator or stored the contents of the accumulator in memory.
    The
    machine did not have floating-point arithmetic because von Neumann felt that any competent mathemati cian
    ought
    to be able to keep track of the decimal point (actually the binary point)
    in his or her head.
    At about the same time von Neumann was building the IAS machine, re- searchers at M.I.T. were also building
    a
    computer. Unlike lAS, ENIAC and other machines of its type, which had long word lengths and were intended
    for
    heavy number crunching, the M.I.T. machine, the Whirlwind I, had a 16-bit word and was designed for
    real-time
    control. This project led to the invention of the magnetic core memory by Jay Forrester, and then eventually
    to
    the first commercial minicomputer.
    While all this was going on, IBM was a small company engaged in the busi- ness of producing card punches and
    mechanical card-sorting machines. Although
    IBM had provided some of Aiken's financing, it was not terribly interested in com- puters until it produced
    the
    701 in 1953, long after Eckert and Mauchley's com- pany was number one in the commercial market with its
    UNIVAC
    computer. The 701 had 2048 36-bit words, with two instructions per word. It was the first in a series of
    scientific machines that came to dominate the industry within a decade.
    Three years later came the 704, which initially had 4096 words of core memory, 36-bit instructions, and a
    new
    innovation, floating-point hardware. In 1958, IBM began production of its last vacuum-tube machine, the 709,
    which was basically a beefed-up 704. <br>
