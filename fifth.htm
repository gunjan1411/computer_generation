        In 1981, the Japanese government announced that they were planning to spend $500 million to help Japanese
        companies develop fifth-generation computers, which would be based on artificial intelligence and represent
        a
        quantum leap over dumb fourth-generation computers.

         Having seen Japanese companies take over the market in
        many
        industries, from cameras to stereos to televisions, American and European computer makers went from 0 to
        full
        panic in a millisecond, de manding government subsidies and more. Despite lots of fanfare, the Japanese
        fifth-generation project basically failed and was quietly abandoned. In a sense, it was like Babbage's
        analytical enginea visionary idea but so far ahead of its tume that the technology for actually building it
        was
        nowhere in sight.
        Nevertheless, what might be called the fifth generation did happen, but in an unexpected way: computers
        shrank.
        In 1989, Grid Systems released the first tablet computer, called the GridPad. It consisted of a small screen
        on
        which the users could write with a special pen to control the system. Systems such as the GridPad
        showed that computers did not need to sit on a desk or in a server room, but 1n- stead,
        could be put into an easy-to-carry package with touchscreens and handwrit- ing recognition to make them even
        more valuable.
        The Apple Newton, released in 1993, showed that a computer could be built in package no bigger than a
        portable
        audiocassette player. Like the GridPad, the
        Newton used handwriting for user input, which in this case proved to be a big stumbling block to its
        success.
        However, later machines of this class, now called
        PDAs (Personal Digital Assistants), have improved user intertaces and are very popular. They have now
        evolved
        into smartphones.
        Eventually, the writing interface of the PDA was perfected by Jeff Hawkins, who had created a company called
        Palm to develop a low-cost PDA for the mass
        Consumer market. Hawkins was an electrical engineer by training, but he had a keen interest in neuroscience,
        which is the study of the human brain. He realized that handwriting recognition could be made more reliable
        by
        training users to write in a manner that was more easily readable by computers, an input technique he called
        "Graffiti." It required a small amount of training for the user, but in the end it led to faster and more
        reliable writing, and the first Palm PDA, called the Palm
        Pilot, was a huge success. Graffiti is one of the great successes in computing.
        demonstrating the power of the human mind to take advantage of the power of thehuman mind.
        Users of PDAS Swore by the devices, religiously using them to manage their schedules and contacts. When cell
        phones started gaining popularity in the early 1990s, IBM jumped at the opportunity to integrate the cell
        phone
        with the PDA, creating the "smartphone." The first smartphone, called Simon, used a touch- screen for input,
        and
        it gave the user all of the capabilities of a PDA plus tele- phone, games, and email. Shrinking component
        sizes
        and cost eventually led to the wide use of smartphones, embodied in the popular Apple iPhone and Google
        Android platforms.
        But even the PDAs and smartphones are not really revolutionary. Even more important are the "invisible"
        computers, which are embedded into appliances.
        watches, bank cards, and numerous other devices (Bechini et al., 2004). These processors allow increased
        functionality and lower cost in a wide variety of appli- cations. Whether these chips form a true generation
        is
        debatable (they have been around since the 1970s), but they are revolutionizing how thousands of appliances
        and
        other devices work. They are already starting to have a major impact on the world and their influence will
        increase rapidly in the coming years. One unusual aspects of these embedded computers is that the hardware
        and
        software are often codesigned (Henkel et al., 2003). We will come back to them later in this book.
        If we see the first generation as vacuum-tube machines (e.g. ENIAC), the sec- ond generation as transistor
        machines (e.g., the IBM 7094), the third generation as early integrated-circuit machines (e.g. the IBM 360),
        and
        the fourth generation as personal computers (e.g., the Intel CPUs), the real fifth generation is more a
        paradigm
        shift than a specific new architecture. In the future, computers will be
        everywhere and embedded in everything-indeed, invisible. They will be part o the
        framework of daily life, opening doors, turning on lights, dispensing money, and doing thousands of other
        things. This model, devised by Mark Weiser. was originally called ubiquitous computing, but the term
        pervasive
        computing is also used frequently now (Weiser, 2002). It will change the world as profoundly as the
        industrial
        revolution did. We will not discuss it further in this book, but for more information about it, see Lyytinen
        and
        Yoo (2002), Saha and Mukherjee (2003).
        and Sakamura (2002).
