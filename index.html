            Hundreds of different kinds of computers have been designed and built during the evolution of the modern
            digital
            computer. Most have been long forgotten, but a few have had a significant impact on modern ideas. In this
            section we will give a brief sketch of some of the key historical developments in order to get a better un-
            derstanding of how we got where we are now. Needless to say, this section only touches on the highlights and
            leaves many stones unturned. Figure 1-4 lists some of the milestone machines to be discussed in this
            section.
            Slater (1987) is a good place to look for additional historical material on the people who founded the com-
            puter age. For short biographies and beautiful color photographs by Louis Fabian
            Bachrach of some of the key people who founded the computer age, see Morgan's coffee-table book (1997).

            The first person to build a working calculating machine was the French scien- tist Blaise Pascal
            (1623-1662), in
            whose honor the programming language Pascal is named. This device, built in 1642, when Pascal was only 19,
            was
            designed to help his father, a tax collector for the French government. It was entirely mechani- cal, using
            gears, and powered by a hand-operated crank. <br>

            The stimulus for the electronic computer was World War II. During the early part of the war, German
            submarines
            were wreaking havoc on British ships. Com- mands were sent from the German admirals in Berlin to the
            submarines
            by radio, which the British could, and did, intercept. The problem was that these messages were encoded
            using a
            device called the ENIGMA, whose forerunner was designed by amateur inventor and former U.S. president,
            Thomas
            Jefferson. <br>

            </div>
            <br>
            Early in the war, British intelligence managed to acquire an ENIGMA machine from Polish Intelligence, which
            had
            stolen it from the Germans. However, to break a coded message, a huge amount ot computation was needed, and
            it
            was needed very soon after the message was intercepted to be of any use. <a href="first.htm">read more</a>

            The transistor was invented at Bell Labs in 1948 by John Bardeen, Walter Brat- tain, and William Shockley,
            for
            which they were awarded the 1956 Nobel Prize in physics. Within 10 years the transistor revolutionized
            computers, and by the late 1950s, vacuum tube computers were obsolete. <br>

            <hr>
            The invention of the silicon integrated circuit by Jack Kilby and Robert Noyce (working independently) in
            1958
            allowed dozens of transistors to be put on a single chip. This packaging made it possible to build computers
            that were smaller, faster, and cheaper than their transistorized predecessors. Some of the more significant
            Computers from this generation are described below.

            put first tens of thousands, then hundreds of thousands, and finally millions of tran- sistors on a single
            chip.
            This development soon led to smaller and faster com- puters. Before the PDP-1, computers were so big and
            expensive that companies and universities had to have special departments called computer centers to run
            them. <a href="four.htm">read more</a>

            In 1981, the Japanese government announced that they were planning to spend $500 million to help Japanese
            companies develop fifth-generation computers, which would be based on artificial intelligence and represent
            a
            quantum leap over dumb fourth-generation computers.
